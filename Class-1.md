[Notes for Class 1](/Class-1.md)

1. Markdown is a markup language.
2. We use markdown to add formatting to documents. You can make headings bigger/smaller, bold/italicize words, list words/sentences, link documents and pictures. 
3. The # symbol will create a heading un markdown. 
    1. To create the largest heading, you will use one #. 
    2. To create the smallest heading, you will use 6 #â€™s. 
4. To make text bold, you can use two sets of ** or __ __. (For example, **This means bold**/__ __This means bold__ __). To make it italicized you only use one set of those symbols (**This is italicized/ _ _This is italicized) 
5. To create a link with markdown, you use brackets with a description of the link, and then the file name inside brackets. For example, on my reading notes repository under class one, I have a file linked by putting [Notes for Class 1](/Class-1.md)
6. Three symbols you can use to create an unordered bullet list are -, *, or +.
