A person who has a growth mindset believes that with time and effort, they will succeed. They look at challenges and obstacles as opportunities to get better, they put in large amounts of effort, learn from their mistakes, and are inspired by others.

Three reminders to myself on how to keep a growth mindset:

-Don't be discouraged when things aren't going well, take a break and then work through the problem.

-I can learn and get better from the people around me, it is not a competition.

-Challenges make you better, don't give up.

1. Markdown is a markup language.
2. We use markdown to add formatting to documents. You can make headings bigger/smaller, bold/italicize words, list words/sentences, link documents and pictures.
3. The # symbol will create a heading un markdown.
    1. To create the largest heading, you will use one #.
    2. To create the smallest heading, you will use 6 #â€™s.
4. To make text bold, you can use two sets of **or __ __. (For example, __This means bold__/__ __This means bold__ __). To make it italicized you only use one set of those symbols (**This is italicized/ __This is italicized)
5. To create a link with markdown, you use brackets with a description of the link, and then the file name inside brackets. For example, on my reading notes repository under class one, I have a file linked by putting [Notes for Class 1] (/Class-1.md)
6. Three symbols you can use to create an unordered bullet list are -, *, or +.
