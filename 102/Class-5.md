## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to style web pages

## Three ways to insert CSS

    1. External CSS
    2. Internal CSS
    3. Inline CSS

- External CSS changes the look of an entire website by changing just one file
- Internal CSS is used if one single html page has a unique style
- Inline CSS applies a unique style for a single element

## An example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text

P {
color: red;  
}
